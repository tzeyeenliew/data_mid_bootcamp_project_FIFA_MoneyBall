## FIFA 2021 Player Performance Prediction

FIFA, a globally renowned console game, has captured the hearts of millions. FIFA 21, the latest installment, stands as a testament to its popularity. This football simulation video game, published by Electronic Arts, is the 28th addition to the FIFA series. Released on October 9, 2020, for platforms like Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, it later saw enhanced versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 3, 2020, with an additional version for Stadia.

### Project Overview
In this project, we delved into the FIFA 21 dataset, a treasure trove of player attributes and performances. Our journey began with thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), dissecting the data to uncover insights. The wealth of data was further brought to life through captivating visualizations created using the powerful Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. With a comprehensive understanding of the data, we ventured into building a Linear model that predicts the overall performance of players.

### Project Highlights
- Explored the FIFA 21 dataset through EDA to uncover player trends and characteristics.
- Visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing a visual narrative of player attributes.
- Constructed a Linear model capable of predicting player overall performance.
- Leveraged a tech stack that included Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
